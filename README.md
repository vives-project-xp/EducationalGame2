## Save the Climate game
- An educational game about climate change
- Made for kids from age 6-10
- Involves diffrent minigames 

In our game u start in a world full of problems like plastic in the ocean, oil in the ocean , overexplotation of fishes , factory emissions... . Then u can play minigames to solve these problems. While solving these problems u get information about the realworld and its climate problems.

1. Our first minigame is PlasticCatch. This involves the player fishing plastic out of the ocean. 

2. The next mini game is Stacking. This minigame involvs the player building a windmill. This game hase different levels and an endless level for the people that want to keep playing. 

3. Our third minigame is FactoryWreking. Here the player needs to destroy an factory with a wreckingball. U can also try to beat ur record time for the destruction of the factory. 

4. The fourth minigame is ForestOnFire. This is a game that looks like flappy bird but we have or own inplementation. U try to get a bird out of a burning forest while catching water to put out the forest fire. After U finish the game u get the option to play the game in endless mode so u can try to beat ur record. 

5. The fifth game is OilCleanup. This game looks a little bit like the PlasticCatch game. Only now there is oil in the ocean that u will have to clean. 

After u finish the game u go back to the main world where u can now see that the problem doesnt exist anymore. Now instead of plastic or oil in the ocean there is fish. Instead of the building blocks of a windmill there is a fully build windmill. This way if the player want to play a minigame again he can still click on it and play it again.
