## Save the Climate game
- An educational game about climate change
- Made for kids from age 6-10
- Involves diffrent minigames 

You start the game on a world full of problems like plastic in the ocean, oil in the ocean , overexplotation of fishes , factory emissions... . Then you can play minigames to solve these problems. 

1. Our first minigame is PlasticCatch. This involves the player fishing plastic out of the ocean. 

2. The next mini game is Stacking. This minigame involvs the player building a windmill. This game has different levels and an endless level for the people that want to keep playing. 

3. Our third minigame is FactoryWreking. Here the player needs to destroy a factory with a wreckingball. You can also try to beat your record time for the destruction of the factory. 

4. The fourth minigame is ForestOnFire. This is a game that looks like flappy bird but we have or own inplementation. You try to get a bird out of a burning forest while catching water to put out the forest fire. After you finish the game you get the option to play the game in endless mode so you can try to beat your record. 

5. The fifth game is OilCleanup. This game looks a little bit like the PlasticCatch game. Only now there is oil in the ocean that you will have to clean. 

After you finish the game you'll go back to the main world where you can now see that the problem doesnt exist anymore. Now instead of plastic or oil in the ocean there is fish. Instead of the building blocks of a windmill there is a build windmill. This way if the player want to play a minigame again he can still click on it and play it again. 

## How we made the game
We used:
- Godot
- C#

For our game we chose to use Gotod C#. We chose for this because godot is a free and decentry easy to use game engine. For all the art work like the world map we drew everything ourself. 
Everyone on the team mostly had there own minigame to work on and we asked eatchother for help if we didnt know how to code something.
